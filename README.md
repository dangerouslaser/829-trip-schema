# 829-trip-schema

Use these files in conjunction with the Advanced Custom Fields plugin to implement Trip Schema on pages featuring trips.

The json file needs to have the page template name updated. The default template is trip-template.php

The php file needs to be installed in the header. Please only install the latest version shown commented in 'trip schema.php' as of version 4.5 . Version 5.0 will have the old versions removed.

The josn file can be implemented within functions.php for increased page load speed.

If the file is imported into ACF as opposed to placed within functions.php please fork the build before doing so and export / save the json file within the branch.
