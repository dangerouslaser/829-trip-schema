# 829-trip-schema

Use these files in conjunction with the Advanced Custom Fields plugin to implement Trip Schema on pages featuring trips.

The json file needs to have the page template name updated and the php file needs to be installed in the header. Please only install the latest version shown in trip schema.php.

The josn file can be implemented within functions.php for increased page load speed.

If the file is imported into ACF please fork the build before doing so.
